This module helped me strengthen my understanding of secure user management in FastAPI.
I learned how password hashing works in practice and why storing plain-text passwords is unsafe. 
Using passlib[bcrypt] gave me a clear picture of how hashing and verification protect users even if the database is exposed.

I also gained new insights into input validation with Pydantic. 
Validators like EmailStr ensure that only correct and safe data enters the system, 
reducing the chances of invalid records or security issues. 
I hadn’t realized that certain Pydantic validators rely on external packages, and missing email-validator caused test collection errors—fixing this taught me to pay closer attention to dependencies.

I faced a couple of hurdles during the project. 
Setting environment variables such as TEST_DATABASE_URL was necessary for integration tests to run successfully with PostgreSQL. 
Another challenge was configuring Docker Hub authentication inside GitHub Actions. 
The image push failed at first because I hadn’t added the required secrets, but once I added my username and token, 
the pipeline worked correctly.
